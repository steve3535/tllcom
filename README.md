## Value proposition  

* How to define Linux sysadmin role today ? it looks like we are wizard and are sentenced for imminent death.  
* Some of us tend to go devops, but is it really our true nature ? I tend to think no: thats not.  
* I believe we belong to the SRE family: we are ops, not dev.  
* So many things have changed and the change is unavoidable even for the dinosaurs: the big on prem monoliths :)  
* How to catch up (for experienced folks) ? How to prepare ? (for ones that are yet to start)  
* This is not a devops training, and lesser a code training: this is modern linux sysadmin training.  
* It will set foundations to transition to SRE  
* It will set foundations for Cloud engineering  
* It will open new opportunities in the Job Market  
* our mission is to collect so many real world cases so that our trainees become true problem solvers for production related systems
* Question: is our product a whole ? can we partner with those taht are providing the dev/sys design courses somehow ?
* Co creation ?  
* 4U
  * Undeserved: we do have so many bootcamps and self paced courses on design and dev
  * Urgent: people want to change their situation now, they want to make more money
  * Unavoidable: how long will u hide from Cloud, AI, microservices, web ??
  * Unworkable: its hard to grasp those skills ..it requires years of experience ...   
  
## Model  

* web based training -- UX
* context mini courses in addition to the scenarii
* 

### GTM  
* social networks:
  * related linkedn posts and groups  
  * twitter tech
* target Africa (IT schools as well ?)
  
### LACKS

* NO CLOUD EXP  
* NO K8S EXP  
* !!! NEED COCREATORS !!!  

## The new stack
* LINUX  
* Python, not Bash
* Web servers, not middleware
* Prometheus + Grafana, not Nagios
* Containers
