## Value proposition  

* How to define Linux sysadmin role today ? it looks like we are wizard and are sentenced for imminent death.  
* Some of us tend to go devops, but is it really our true nature ? I tend to think no: thats not.  
* I believe we belong to the SRE family: we are ops, not dev.  
* So many things have changed and the change is unavoidable even for the dinosaurs: the big on prem monoliths :)  
* How to catch up (for experienced folks) ? How to prepare ? (for ones that are yet to start)  
* This is not a devops training, and lesser a code training: this is modern linux sysadmin training.  
* It will set foundations to transition to SRE  
* It will set foundations for Cloud engineering  
* It will open new opportunities in the Job Market  
* our mission is to collect so many real world cases so that our trainees become true problem solvers for production related systems
